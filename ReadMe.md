# Password Strength Checker

A beginner-friendly Python project to evaluate password strength based on common security criteria.

## Features

- **Checks for Password Criteria**: Evaluates passwords based on length, presence of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provides detailed feedback on password strength, indicating areas for improvement.
- **Breach Detection**: Checks if the password has been involved in known data breaches.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates the entropy of the password to assess its randomness.
- **Password Suggestions**: Generates strong password suggestions to help users create secure passwords.

## How It Works

The Password Strength Checker is designed to assess the strength of a password by checking it against predefined criteria. It evaluates the password's length, character types, and provides feedback on how to improve its strength. Additionally, it checks if the password has been compromised in any known data breaches and calculates its entropy to give an idea of its security level.
